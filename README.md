# leekcode

Codes I wrote in answering LeetCode problems. They're either not the best implementation (I'm very sure about that), but the point in compiling my answers here is to learn in solving different programming problems (in which, in all honesty, I'm not very good at--and this is me saying even if I'm in Graduate School). **Goal is to try, as much as I can, to answer one problem per day.**

Below are the list of problems that I answered (in order of answering):

1. [Two Sum](twosum.py) (05/01)
2. [Reverse Integer](reverseint.py) (05/01)
3. [Add Two Numbers](addtwonumbers.py) (05/02)
